# Mutation Classifier: A Dive Into Genetic Pattern Recognition

This pipeline takes a deep look into a genetic mutation dataset, cleans it up, finds patterns, and ultimately predicts mutation classes using logistic regression. The idea is simple: genes tell a story â€” and weâ€™re trying to decode it using numbers.
What this project does:
Cleans messy genetic data by removing duplicates and filling in blanks (because data, like people, deserves a second chance).

Normalizes and scales mutation counts so we can fairly compare apples to apples... or rather, genes to genes.

Uses feature selection to keep only the most informative data (less noise, more insight).

Trains a Logistic Regression model to classify the type of mutation â€” and evaluates its performance with precision, recall, and a crystal-clear confusion matrix heatmap.

In essence, this project is like giving your raw genomic spreadsheet a caffeine boost and asking it to predict the future. ðŸ§ªâš¡
